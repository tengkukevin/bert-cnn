my room-mate called me to ask me to go out for a stroll.  I tried á

to talk to her anymore.á

each one of them."

college for our lecture and I saw him with her.  He put one arm á
around her shoulder and laugher brightly and joyfully.  I did not á

When I found that any tasks or decisions that I had made were better  á
than expected.]"

bear our responsibilities as her children.  My mother had tried á
her best to take care of us but she lived in pain these two á
years.  Neither the doctor nor we could do anything for her as á

suffernig , even die instead of her."

soft sunlight to try and uplift my spirits.  When I was having á

why I was dressed so nicely (they had seldom joked with me á
before).  One of them said that he had a lounge suit and we would á
look very nice if we wore them together."

the homework and not social gatherings.  We were very busy and á

hour waiting for her as we could do nothing else then."

have the next discussion ( I had many tests the coming week and á
could not have a meeting in between, I thought that they would á
understand this as they had always done).  They did not á
understand my problem and thought that I should not have so many á
other activities.  Their reaction made me burst into tears."
happy,"It was the first time I met him (my boyfriend Mr.W).  It was á
during the first term Summer vacations.  We met each other while á

and freely."

mother about it.  When my mother learnt this she beat her up and á
even threatened her with a pair of scissors.  "

for her call, she did not call me that night."

my fellow mates."

youth center with a few other volunteers.  I was the head of the á
organizors and we spent over a month planning it.  During this á
period we got to know and understood each other.  We á
discovered each others potential and we planned many interesting á
things for the carnival.  The day of the carnival everything was á
bright, the programmes went well and the attendants enjoyed it.  á
I felt extremely excited about it."

others that I would take down the names of the people who á
misbehaved and after some time I sat down for a brief rest.  á

It was not a great loss from the monetary point of view but I á
lost some documents - identity papers.  As a result I had to á
spend several days in order to get a new one.  I will always á
remember all the work I had to do and the bad treatment I á
suffered because of the bureaucratic behaviour of the civil á
servant.  I had already had bad luck and they treated me like a á
criminal.   At one point of time I really wanted to quarrel with á
them."

against her boyfriend.  Consequently she looked through me when á

we (6 of us) waited for the members of the band to greet us in á
front of the stage.  We went out after a few minutes as it was á
time to close the hall.  We had been waiting at the entrance hall á
for ten minutes when three of the band members came out.  They á
were very excited to see us, one of them was so excited that he á

should have been a happy day and three we had moved into a new á
house that day."

time.  "

houses in the New Territories (villages) but they did not have á
much furniture.  He took me to see his fields (I had never seen á
them before) and there were several inches of clear water on á
which the sunshine was reflected.  I wanted to sit among the á
short green plants in the fields but was afraid of treading the á
plants to death.  My friend said ""They will not die"" and I sat á
down happily and my trousers did not get wet."
angry,"My friend often played a joke on me and sometimes I thought that á
he was a nonsensical person. Once when we went to a friend's á
house he walked in first and shut the door firmly behind him.  I á

he should not have behaved like that.  I was very angry (as it is á
I was in a bad mood then)."
sad,"I suddenly found that those whom I considerered to be my good á
friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them á
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind á
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made á
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was á
sad when I decided that they were no longer my good friends."
happy,"During the exam period I studied in the library alone.  A close   á
friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my á
application for a Japanese inter-cultural exchange programme had á
been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the á
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was á

day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the á
good news.  I was so happy that I could not concentrate on my á
studies. á
"

carefully and found that my results were much better than I á
had expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My á
diligence had paid and I was very happy."

uncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him á
furiously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence á
because of traditional moral values.  "

cracked jokes, I was very happy.  However, I felt that I may have  á
said something inappropriate which might cause them to have a bad  á
impression of me."
angry,"My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á
insulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á
not feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á
friends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á
person.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á
nothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á
say anything but just watched me leave."
sad,"Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before á
the result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I á

content of the experiment and did not know how to do it."

and my tears made me sad."
happy,"In August,1983, the long awaited ""big envelope"" (a document for á
C.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had á
not been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag, á
knocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly á
opened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. á
 It lasted several hours and only calmed down later."
angry,"In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me "" A failure, You lost á
5 marks.""   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work."
sad,"This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á
I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock."
happy,I received a letter from a distant friend.
angry,"Two years back someone invited me to be the tutor of her á
grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in á
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me á
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be á
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á
child to teach."
sad,"I had taken the responsibility to do something and I had á
prepared for it.  However I failed because of my timidity.  After á
three attempts I still could not adapt to the atmosphere and á
failed as before.  I felt imcompetent and felt that the others á
would think that I had not prepared for it."
